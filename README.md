# Poetry-and-Little-Review-Analysis
The “Poetry and the Little Review” Network Analysis aims to examine the relationships between notable modernist authors.

This project is composed by two datasets: a node dataset and an edge dataset.

The nodes csv contains authors, and the edges csv contains weighted publication relationships between those authors, which were calculated based on how many times each author appeared with another author in the same journal issue.

It is an undirect dataset, and so connections between elements have no specific directions, therefore it means that the relationships or interactions between elements are bidirectional or symmetric.
